**0-isupper.c:** checks for uppercase character.

- Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
- Returns 1 if `c` is uppercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

**1-isdigit.c:** checks for a digit (0 through 9).

- Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
- Returns 1 if `c` is a digit
- Returns 0 otherwise

**2-mul.c:** multiplies two integers.

- Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

**3-print_numbers.c:** prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_numbers(void);

**4-print_most_numbers.c:**  prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
- Does not print 2 and 4

**5-more_numbers.c:** prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void more_numbers(void);

**6_print_line.c:** draws a straight line in the terminal.

- Prototype: void print_line(int n);
- Where `n` is the number of times the character _ should be printed
- The line should end with a \n
- If `n` is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

**7-print_diagonal.c:** draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

- Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);
- Where `n` is the number of times the character \ should be printed
- The diagonal should end with a \n
- If `n` is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n

**8-print_square.c:** prints a square, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_square(int size);
- Where `size` is the `size` of the square
- If `size` is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
- Use the character # to print the square

**9-fizz_buzz.c:** prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

- Each number or word should be separated by a space

**10-prints_triangle.c:** prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);
- Where `size` is the `size` of the triangle
- If `size` is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
- Use the character # to print the triangle

**100-prime_factor.c:** finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
